# Key-Point-Detection-in-Emotional-AI
In this project, I have detected key points from the face that can be further extended for emotional AI applications.  
An example is given below

The directory structure after training should be like this

I have given a colab notebook too. You need not download anything since it is Ready-to-Run notebook. Make sure to use GPU while training.
